# AOSPWiki
A wide range of articles and guides on Android development can be found across various platforms, including popular resources like XDA Forums. However, many of [these resources](./legacy-articles.md) have become outdated as Android continues to evolve, with new features introduced and older ones deprecated over time.

This project is dedicated to keeping up with the latest developments in the Android Platform, consolidating all relevant information into a single comprehensive wiki.

## Getting started

With a staggering 3 billion devices running Android, it’s one of the largest and most influential operating systems globally. The evolution has been phenomenal, and with countless new features and smartphones being released by various OEMs, there’s never been a more exciting time to dive into Android platform engineering.
