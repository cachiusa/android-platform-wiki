## About this wiki
A wide range of articles and guides on Android development can be found across various platforms, including popular resources like XDA Forums. However, many of these resources have become outdated as Android continues to evolve, with new features introduced and older ones deprecated over time.

This project is dedicated to keeping up with the latest developments in the Android Platform, consolidating all relevant information into a single comprehensive wiki.
